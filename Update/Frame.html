<p class="Para1"><b>Apple</b> Card is getting its first group of public test users today. 
A limited amount of customers that signed up to be notified about the 
release of Apple Card are getting the ability to apply for the card in 
their Wallet app today — as well as the option to order their physical 
Apple Card. I’ve been using the card for a few days on my own device, 
making purchases and payments and playing around with features like Apple 
Cash rewards and transaction categorization. A full rollout of Apple Card 
will come later in August. It requires iOS 12.4 and up to operate.
The application process was simple for me. Portions of the information 
you need are pre-filled from your existing AppleID account, making for 
less manual entry. I had an answer in less than a minute and was ready 
to make my first purchase instantly. I used it both online and in person 
with contactless terminals. It…works.
The card on the screen has a clever mechanism that gives you a sort of 
live heat map of your spending categories. The color of the card will 
shift and blend according to the kinds of things you buy. Spend a lot at 
restaurants and the card will take on an orange hue. Shop for entertainment-related 
items and the card shifts into a mix of orange and pink. It’s a clever take on the 
chart-based spending category features many other credit cards have built into their websites.
